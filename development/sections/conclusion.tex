\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The paper has extended existing transformational design approaches into a novel system design methodology. A key idea is to center the methodology around a coherent system model view (\textit{RAMP}), where the system at each transformation step is expressed as a tuple of requirements, application model, platform model, and mapping model. This enables to systematically refine both application and platform model, which significantly increases the potential to identify an efficient implementation. The main concepts and mechanisms of the method have been illustrated by a representative example. Future work will cover the development of tool support for the methodology and an extension of the transformation library.
%Future work: safety aspects.
%We have extended and wrapped exiting transformation-based approaches in a systematic fully transformational design methodology. The proposed methodology transforms different parts of the system model, \textit{RAMP}, and traverses numerous design points. A pattern recognition method is used as a lever to detect potential transformations, which in turn show the design alternatives up. A running example of an image processing application has demonstrated how to apply step-wise transformations to develop a system. Although the example shows the potentials of the methodology, it is definitely needed to design application-specific transformation rules. Future work will focus on automation of the methodology and  enriching the transformation library. Pattern recognition tool is under development.
