\label{sec:classification}

%\todo[backgroundcolor=blue!5!white,bordercolor=blue!45!black, inline]{@Rui: Classification of transformation rules based on Ingo's paper and other related work.} 
In the following a classification of transformation rules is presented:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Semantic/non-semantic preserving transformations:}
    \item \textit{Trustable/un-trustable transformations:} 
    %The  final  implementation  is  either  a  trueimplementation  of  the  initial  specificationwhich is guaranteed by the use of semanticspreserving    transformation    rules    in    thelibrary, or can be proofed correct for certainassumptions  w.r.t  non-semantics  preservingtransformations   which   are   introduced   bydesign decisions \cite{wu2001transformational}.
    \item \textit{Platform-dependent/platform-independent transformations:}
    \item \textit{Glass-box/black-box transformations:}
    %functions are seen as atoms and can not be refined during the black-box refinements.
    \item \textit{Vertical/horizontal transformations:}
\end{itemize}

This section will be completed in the final version of the document (deliverable
D3.3).
